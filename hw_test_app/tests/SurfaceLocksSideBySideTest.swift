/// Two threads CPU-lock two IOSurfaces the GPU is still writing, at the same time: each lock waits for its own surface's
/// writer and no longer, as on Apple's GPUs, so neither sleeps through the other surface's GPU work. One queue runs both
/// writers in order, B's long render then A's, each about `targetMs` of full-surface draws (sized by a timed render of a
/// third surface made the same way). One thread locks A; 2 ms later another locks B. B's writer ends where A's starts, so
/// B's lock must return before A's by at least half of A's GPU time. Reported: each lock's wait, how long both waited at
/// once (`overlap_ms`) and the pixel each lock read (the render's colour, or the lock did not wait for its writer).
/// The kernel's system-wide CPU sync (gpu_sync.c tegra_gm20b_sync_for_cpu, whose global sync_lock KB-784 removed) takes
/// over only for a surface whose writer slots overflowed, five channels with unfinished writes of it, which one process
/// cannot make; the debug line "tegra-gm20b: unlocked waits: N CPU syncs beside another" counts those on a device.
/// The surfaces: block-linear as the GPU's first write decides them (TegraGM20BTiled.cpp), or (`_pitch`) pitch, each
/// first imported by a texture that only samples it.
