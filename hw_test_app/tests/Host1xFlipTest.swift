/// Window A flipped by host1x instead of the CPU (drivers/NativeMobileDisplay/SwitchHost1xFlipDisplay.h, debug
/// kernels): each flip is a class 0x70 stream on the display's own host1x channel, held behind its producer's syncpoint
/// (the kernel stands in for the producer), and judged by the display's latch check at the next frame end. The two
/// surfaces are the same pages at two addresses, so the panel does not change. The teardown arm fails the middle
/// flip's producer: the channel is torn down before that stream can write, the display's work loop writes the flip,
/// and the restarted channel carries the rest. d_host1x_flips is kern.switch_flips_host1x across the run. Runs after
/// the other display tests: it holds the swaps for about a second.
