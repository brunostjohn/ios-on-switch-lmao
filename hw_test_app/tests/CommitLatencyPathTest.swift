/// What a commit waits for (RawMetalPipeline.mm, debug builds): Core Animation shaped command buffers recorded at the
/// render thread's pace (a pass every 400 us, its draws binding vertices, transform and uniforms by setBytes under a
/// scissor of their own), each committed, waited for scheduled as the render server does before its swap, then for its
/// completion on an otherwise idle GPU. Per shape (one pass of 6 draws; 15 passes of 90 draws over 4 targets; the same
/// with a shared event signalled between passes 8 and 9; the same with its last pass into a drawable it presents): the
/// commit call's time, waitUntilScheduled's, and the time from the commit to the GPU starting its submission (its start
/// stamp on the CPU's clock), and how many of its encoders the submit worker encoded before the commit. A shape without
/// an event must have all but the encoders recorded since the worker was last handed the buffer (24 tape commands, 3
/// of these passes) and the two held for the look-ahead encoded ahead; its median from commit to GPU start must stay
/// under what the remainder, the kernel's SubmitJob and a thread hop take (the encode was 2.2-4.6 ms of a scale frame
/// before, boot 21); the event's shape is encoded at its commit, as before. Each pass draws into BGRA8 beside a
/// memoryless colour 1, as the state's line has it. A pack without the state (24B119's) sends its first command buffers
/// to m2v while the runtime makes its record: those warm it before any shape runs.
