// Every interrupt pending at this core's CPU interface, until GICC_IAR reads spurious. `cpu` provides acknowledge()
// (GICC_IAR), end(acknowledge) (GICC_EOIR, with the source CPU bits of an SGI), timer() for PPI 27, ipi(acknowledge)
// for SGI 0 and other(intid) for everything else (the SPIs). Each class pays for what it needs:
//   * SGI 0: a read barrier after the acknowledge. The sender stored its IPI state (XNU cpu_signal_internal's
//     cpu_signal bits and xcall arguments), then a store barrier, then GICD_SGIR; this pairs with that (Linux
//     gic_handle_irq's smp_rmb), so the handler reads the state the IPI announces. Nothing to order before the EOI.
//   * PPI 27: an ISB before the EOI. XNU's rtclock_intr re-arms the timer with an MSR to CNTV_TVAL_EL0 and no ISB
//     (ml_set_decrementer, both trees); the ISB puts that write, and the timer's level drop with it, in effect before
//     the EOI, so the GIC does not take the level PPI again. A DSB does not synchronize an MSR.
//   * SPIs: a DSB before the EOI, so the driver's status clear, or ArmGIC's mask of the line (runVector), reaches its
//     device before the EOI and a level line is not taken again.
//   * the spurious read that ends the loop: nothing is read on its account and nothing is ended.
// No barrier after the EOI (Linux has none either): the next GICC_IAR read goes to the same Device peripheral, so the EOI
// arrives before it, and the exception return synchronizes.
