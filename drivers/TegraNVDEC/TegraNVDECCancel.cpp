// A decode past its bound: NVDEC stopped making progress on it (the GP timer ends a picture the firmware cannot finish
// long before; a lost syncpoint interrupt panics in TegraHost1x instead). As L4T's nvhost does on a channel timeout,
// and as TegraNVENC and TegraNVJPG do, the jobs are cancelled, not the engine. The fence fails on host1x's work loop,
// which must not sleep, and the falcon's proof waits on a fence that loop delivers, so the cancellation runs on its own
// thread call; the queue holds new jobs from the failure until it is done (SwitchNVDECJobs.cpp):
//   - channel 0 is torn down, so nothing more of the queued streams reaches the engine;
//   - NVDEC's memory client is flushed and the engine reset with its partition kept on;
//   - every queued job the syncpoint has not reached fails (-5, a failed picture for VideoToolbox), recorded as failed
//     before the syncpoint is released through it: another engine's stream may be waiting on it;
//   - the channel is restarted, the falcon booted and proven as at power-on;
//   - once the cancelled jobs have ended, the queue renumbers from the syncpoint and the next job runs.
// The flush, reset and restart run under the power lock, as at power-on: NVJPG's power path writes MC_HOTRESET_CTRL_1
// too. The falcon's reboot and proof run without it, under a hold of NVDEC's idle gate (no idle power-off, sleep waits
// for the release), so NVJPG's decodes and power transitions go on meanwhile: they touch NVDEC's clock only through the
// MBIST workaround, which on T210 before B01 turns on a clock that is off and leaves NVDEC's running one on, and on
// T210B01 does not run. Parking an engine that did not come back writes its clock and reset, so it takes the lock
// again. An engine sleep has already powered off is not touched; its next power-on boots it. An engine the reset does
// not bring back is parked and the idle gate powers it on at a later decode. One line per cancellation.
