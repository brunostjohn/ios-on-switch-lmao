// Host test of drivers/NativeMobileDisplay/VsyncPhase.h: the adaptive vsync phase against a model compositor at 60 Hz. Each frame boundary latches the newest flip that was asked for before it.
// The compositor draws when a vsync reaches it (at V_BLANK with no lead, `lead` before the next boundary with one):
// CPU work, then the swap, then GPU work, then the flip; frames whose flip misses its boundary are shown a frame later or
// replaced by the next one. Scenarios: r8a's quiet windows (2-3 ms responses), the same with rare 8 ms stalls, a client
// at 20 Hz (r8a's clock widget), and a compositor that copies (10 ms responses). Checks: latch wait, frames late or lost
// against no phase, the lead it settles on, the misses it takes, and paced().
