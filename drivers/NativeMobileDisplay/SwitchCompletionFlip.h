// A window A flip that the producer's completion writes itself. The offer prepares it under the display's gate (the
// ring entry, its START_ADDR and layout); the completion writes it from whichever thread delivers it (the GPU's
// interrupt pass, a present work item), or the producer's interrupt filter writes it earlier still, before the
// completion is delivered; the gate puts it in the ring at the completion's own pass, which the next frame end runs
// first when it comes before. Only the gate arms, so a flip it sees idle cannot be written behind its back.
//
// No lock: the state and the arm's generation are one word, and every transition is one store or one compare-and-swap
// on it. A writer claims an armed flip (kClaimed) before its register stores and publishes kEarly or kWritten after
// them, with interrupts off between (its stores are a few posted writes), so whoever meets kClaimed waits only for
// those. The generation in the word makes a stale claimer (a filter left from an earlier offer) fail its swap. The rest
// is written by one side at a time: the gate's arm before the word says kArmed, the claimer's times while it holds
// kClaimed; each is read after the word that published it.
