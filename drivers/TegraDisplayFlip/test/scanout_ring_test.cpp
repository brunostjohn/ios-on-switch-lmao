// drivers/TegraDisplayFlip/TegraScanoutRing.h on the host, against a model of DC A's window A latch: an assembly START_ADDR, the
// active one, and ACT_REQ, which a frame boundary consumes by copying assembly to active. The driver side does what
// NativeLegacyDisplay does under its gate (swaps arrive and are kicked, copies complete and flip, frame-end actions check the
// latch), in random order against boundaries that may fall anywhere, including between a flip's START_ADDR store and its
// ACT_REQ store, and several of which may pass before the frame-end action runs (folded frame ends). Checked:
//  - no frame is ever written into a buffer DC A scans or could take at the next boundary;
//  - a buffer being copied into is never scanned;
//  - a frame whose flip was complete before a boundary is on screen from that boundary on (or a newer one is);
//  - latch() reads every hardware state right (never inconsistent; taken means scanned);
//  - with two buffers it is plain double buffering: nothing is replaced and frames wait for the latch;
//  - against a controller that ignores a START_ADDR store while a request is out (one way DC A could differ from the model),
//    the first replacement reads as inconsistent, recover() falls back to double buffering, replacement comes back after the
//    ring's run of plain latches and falls back again, and every check above but the latest-frame one keeps holding, with
//    presents going on.
