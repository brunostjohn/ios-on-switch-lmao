// Rule resolve.twod: where an MSAA resolve is the 2D engine's 2:1 box of the sample grid (raw_resolve_twod.cpp) instead
// of the pack's resolve pass.
//
// The engine reads each unorm8 code c as round(c * 2^15 / 255) before its box and stores the mean by the ROP's unorm
// rule (x1-units UNITS.md: cut to n+4 fractional bits, nearest, ties down), where Metal's resolve is (sum + n/2) / n,
// ties up; no 902d method sets either (cl902d.h). That reading gives gpu.raw.resolve_twod's per-channel 2x counts on
// boots 19 and 21 exactly (raw_resolve_rule_test.cpp). A half-code mean lands on either side of the tie by the codes'
// rounding, so the plain box is within one code of Metal and so is its complement (resolve.exact: every sample made
// 255 - c in place, the box read under ROP3 NOTSRCCOPY): on 896 of the 65,536 sample pairs both land one under Metal,
// where the pair (k, k) gives the same two codes, so no ROP3 of the two readings is exact either. The complement is
// therefore no route; it stays the probe's (RawMetalProbe.mm switchRawProbeResolveExact:) as a reading of the engine.
