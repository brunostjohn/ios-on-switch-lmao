// Private render targets on compressed memory (rule comp.private). A private 2D texture of one sample (its mip chain too)
// or 2D array of one level, or a stored multisampled one, that only the 3D engine renders, shaders store to and the texture
// unit samples is bound with its texel size's compressible kind when
// compressed memory of its size is ready (Device::comp_, made off the render thread), so its full clears to a ZBC value
// write tags only and its draws move compressed tiles. The kind must be one the copy engine reads and writes as plain
// texels (raw_comp.h copyEngineReadsCompressed: the move below is its copy); passes that view it as a storage image do so
// in place (raw_storage_form.h rule storage.compressed).
//
// Nothing else may name its pages: an m2v twin aliases them through NVK's plain binding and would read compressed bytes.
// So before a twin, a view (which copies the memory's address) or a gpuResourceID (which names the header) is taken, the
// texture moves to plain block-linear memory: the copy engine copies it there in a raw job, ordered before every later
// raw job by the channel and before NVK's next submission by Order, and later work binds a new header over the plain
// memory. Work already submitted keeps the old header and memory, which stay until the texture goes.
