// Guards on why an MTLFence needs no push of its own on the raw path (RawMetalFences.mm), which no host model runs: every
// encoder the raw path opens begins with a drain or an engine change, which waits for the engine left behind
// (raw_barrier_forms.h), the raw encode emits nothing for a fence, and m2v's replay of a refused encoder gets the fence's
// twin, never the device's own object. When an encoder opens with neither, fences need a barrier.
