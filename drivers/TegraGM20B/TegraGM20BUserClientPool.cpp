// A view only we hold is mapped nowhere (an IOMemoryMap holds its descriptor), and nothing can map it any more. But
// releasing it destroys its device pager's VM object, which first waits (uninterruptibly, vm_object_destroy ->
// vm_object_paging_wait) for every UPL on that object to be committed, and the retain count does not show those: an import
// of the view's mapping (BoImport of the WC pages, m2v's twin of a raw buffer) holds one until its own BO is released,
// maybe on another connection, maybe later on the very thread that freed the view. So no client thread releases a view:
//  - a dying task closes its connections one after the other on one thread; if the raw connection's view goes first,
//    the twin's connection, which would complete that UPL, never gets closed (the task's exit hangs in
//    vm_object_destroy under AGXDeviceUserClient::releaseBo <- clientClose until the watchdog panics);
//  - the same wait on a live task's thread: a BoFree of a raw buffer no task maps any more, or a BoAlloc that releases
//    orphans inline, with the buffer's twin import still live: the compositor's thread waits for an import only it
//    would free.
// Here a run that meets such a view waits for its import to go, with the rest of the batch it took behind it; orphans
// freed meanwhile get a run of their own (the call is not ONCE: XNU thread_call.c _pending_call_enqueue queues a running
// non-ONCE call again, and the kernel group is TCG_PARALLEL, so another thread runs it). A view whose twin a long-lived
// process keeps holds its batch's pages until that import is freed or the process exits.
