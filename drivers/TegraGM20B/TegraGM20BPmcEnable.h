/* GPU PMC_ENABLE (0x000200), one reset bit per engine (nvkm's mc reset maps), has no set/clear alias on GM20B, and its
 * changes come from different contexts: an engine's first use and last (nvkm_subdev_init/fini under that subdev's
 * use.mutex, reached from chan_new under tgm_gpu.lock), a recovery's engine reset (tgm_engine_reset_locked under its
 * runlist's mutex), the PMU's and GR's own resets, the mc subdev's init. Two read-modify-writes that interleave lose one
 * engine's bit, leaving it in reset (or out of it) until its next init. Every change takes one spinlock (gpu_pmc.c), as
 * nvgpu's mc_enable_lock does (common/mc/mc_gm20b.c:223-241): these are setup, teardown and recovery steps, never per
 * frame, and their contexts are nvkm's own, so no single thread owns them all. test/gm20b_pmc_enable_test.cpp. */
