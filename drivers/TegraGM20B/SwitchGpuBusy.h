/* Which hardware channels may have work the GPU has not finished, from words per channel with one writer each: the
 * newest seqno kicked (the channel's submission owner), the newest the interrupt pass saw done (the pass), and the newest
 * the idle clock's settle read from the fence (a quiet job no pass saw end). `live` lists the live channels and `low`
 * those below the high level, a high kick's possible victims; only a channel's creation, level change and teardown write
 * them. A high kick and the deadline read these to leave PFIFO's registers alone while no app has work, and the idle
 * clock to know the GPU idle.
 *
 * Readers load the done word before the kicked one, so a stale done word (a quiet job no pass has seen end) reads as
 * work in flight and costs the register reads it would have saved. A reader in the instant of a kick finds the app
 * idle, as one that reads PFIFO before the app's doorbell lands does. */
