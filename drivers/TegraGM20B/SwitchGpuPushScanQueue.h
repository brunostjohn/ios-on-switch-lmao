// render server waits for that thread (waitUntilScheduled), and reading 36-57 KiB of a compositor frame's pushes through
// the write-combined mapping cost it every 4th submission on boot 21. The caller serialises reserve/publish and
// take/done under its lock; a record taken is read outside it, since reserve never hands out a slot before its done.
